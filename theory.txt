we must add button "delete" near each employee
when we press this button - we must see new window with form to confirm the deletion the employee's data:


    Delete Employee:
        1. new button "delete" for list-employee.html


                delete button includes employee id:
                <tr th:each="tempEmployee" : ${employees}">
                ...
                <td>
                <a th:href:"@{/employees/delete(employeeId=${templEmployee.id})}"
                        class="btn btn-info btn-sm"
                        onclick="if(!(confirm('Are u sure u want to delete this employee?'))) return false">
                    Delete
                </a>
                </td>


        2. add controller code for "Delete"

                in Controller

                        @GetMapping("/delete")
                        public String showFormForUpdate(@RequestParam("employeeId") int Id){ //
                            //save employee
                            employeeService.deleteById(Id);

                            return "redirect: employees/list"
                        }
